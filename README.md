My playground.

For the time being, I will make incompatible changes.

## Dependencies

- Python 3 (Probably works with Python 3.9 or later, developed with 3.10)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- See requirements.txt

We usually support the latest version. If there are bugs or compatibility issues, we will specify the version.

- [INSTALL-ubuntu](INSTALL-ubuntu.md)
- [INSTALL-windows](INSTALL-windows.md)

## waifu2x

[waifu2x](./waifu2x)

Image Super-Resolution for Anime-Style Art. And it supports photo models (GAN based models)

The repository contains waifu2x pytorch implementation and pretrained models.

See [waifu2x/README.md](waifu2x/README.md)

The demo application can be found at
- https://waifu2x.udp.jp/ (Cloud version)
- https://unlimited.waifu2x.net/ (In-Browser version).

## cliqa

[cliqa](./cliqa)

`cliqa` provides low-vision image quality scores that are more consistent across different images.

It is useful for filtering low-quality images with a threshold value when creating image datasets.
